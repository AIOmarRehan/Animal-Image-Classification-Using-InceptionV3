# Animal-Image-Classification-Using-InceptionV3
This project builds an animal image classification system using TensorFlow and InceptionV3. It includes a full data-cleaning pipeline that detects corrupted images, duplicates, brightness issues, and mislabeled samples before training a transfer-learning model for accurate and reliable predictions.
